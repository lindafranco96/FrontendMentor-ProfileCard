### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to better accommodate things with flexbox, it was something I kept struggling with, but I was able to improve


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1 - w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me with the problem of aligning the components that I was creating, since I didn't understand well why certain things were not accommodated, but in the end reading more information I saw where my error was.
